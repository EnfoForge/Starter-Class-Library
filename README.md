# CFIHOS 2.0-Compliant Starter Class Library

## Introduction

This repository provides a **CFIHOS 2.0-compliant starter class library** designed to serve as a foundational framework for Engineering Information Management (EIM). It offers a structured and standards-aligned approach to managing engineering data across capital projects and operational assets.

The library translates the CFIHOS specification into a practical, extensible codebase, enabling organizations to accelerate the development of digital solutions that adhere to industry standards. It is intended as a starting point for building company-specific class libraries that reflect internal data models, workflows, and integration requirements.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this class library is to bridge the gap between the CFIHOS standard and real-world implementation. By providing a ready-to-use, open-source framework, it simplifies the process of adopting CFIHOS and customizing it to meet the unique needs of individual organizations.

## Starter Class Library White Paper

EF-JS-8380-0001 - Starter Class Library - White Paper ,Provides an overview of the CFIHOS-compliant starter class libraryâ€™s purpose, design, and benefits. Details the architecture, customization options, and integration pathways with company specific workflows. Explains industry standards alignment and offers best practices for implementing and extending the class library in real-world environments.


## Key Features
